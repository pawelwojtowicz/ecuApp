# ecuApp
The ecuApp is a simple application framework, which will be used further to build the home automation system.
It was used from the beginning as a playground for the linux platform learning. Maybe it can be done better - maybe it will be.


versions:

v1.16.00 - the last version which was including the custom deployment scripts and manually crafted makefiles.
            The deployment scripts were able to prepare the minimal linux disctribution and prepare the rootfile system to be
            able to get it started on the qemu
            
v1.20    - first version from the master branch which uses the CMAKE build system.
